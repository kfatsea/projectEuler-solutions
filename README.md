A multi-language implementation of Project Euler problems with ocassional design pattern integration. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

### Broad Language Familiarity
- Implement solutions in **Python** first (prototyping)
- Translate solutions to:
  - **Java** (OOP focus)
  - **C++** (low-level optimization)
  - **Rust** (memory safety)
- Consider Haskell and Clojure if time constraints allow.

### Pattern Integration
- Map certain problems to 1-2 design patterns. 
- Document pattern applications in `/docs/patterns.md`

!!! Many problems in project Euler are relatively simple and may not require design patterns. Only problems that benefit from design pattern solutions will be addressed in this part of the project. For the rest, the focus will remain on providing multi-language solutions.
